### FuzzyFusion_DeepLearning_Tutorial

# Fuzzy Fusion of Decisions from Heterogeneous Deep Machine Learning Models

This tutorial will teach participants three key skills that are critical to 
advancing research in computational intelligence:

1) use of Keras and TensorFlow;
2) deep learning models and transfer learning techniques; and
3) fuzzy machine learning model fusion.

The tutorial session will be broken into these three portions, 
each of which culminates in code examples that can be immediately 
migrated from the tutorial to the participants own research thrusts 
(theories and applications). The session will conclude with a 
case-study demonstrating how the components have been tied together 
for scientific studies in remote sensing.
